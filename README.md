# Snake
## How to play
- The only thing you actually need is the snake.jar file
- Simply run it to play

## Settings
- Dark Mode: Activates a really budget dark mode
- Delay: Lower delay means more ticks aka. faster snake movement
- Snake color sliders: Should be self-explanatory

## Why
- I created this to get a feeling for GUI's in Java
- I also wanted to apply the MVC concept to a small programm
