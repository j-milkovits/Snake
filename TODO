    ✔ view @done(03.05.20 - 15:02)
        ✔ GameScreen @done(03.05.20 - 11:02)
            JPanel, that will hold GamePlayScreen and GameControlScreen
            Will be opened and close depending on the main menu actions/WindowManagement
        ✔ GamePlayScreen @done(03.05.20 - 12:20)
            This will hold the game itself
            Curretnlöy about to do a 32x32 GridLayOut with 32x32 panels inside that
        ✔ GameControlScreen @done(03.05.20 - 12:20)
            This will hold the controll stuff for the window
            Probably 4 panels that control the snake via mouseover
            Menu Button to go back to the menu
            Label that displays the score
        ✔ StartScreen @done(03.05.20 - 10:41)
            Will get created by the main method
            basically shows the name of the game and some more buttons
            Start Game
            Controls
            Highscores?
        ✔ Listeners @done(03.05.20 - 13:09)
            ✔ startButtonListener @done(03.05.20 - 12:22)
                Listener for the Start button on the StartScreen
                this will disable the StartScreen and call a method that starts the game in WindowManagement
            ✔ MouseListeners for GameControlScreen @done(03.05.20 - 13:09)
            ✔ buttonListener for BackToMenu @done(03.05.20 - 12:47)
                should be working? had some issues with getParent() because there are like 3 layers between the JPanel and the JFrame

    ✔ model @done(03.05.20 - 15:02)
        ✔ Snake @done(03.05.20 - 15:02)
            ArrayList of Position that holds the whole snake
            If time continues, will delete the first element and add the new position of the head to the end of the list
            If a fruit gets eaten, the next time cycle won't delete the first element
        ✔ Position @done(03.05.20 - 15:02)
            Class to store the width- and heightcoordinate
    ✔ controller @done(03.05.20 - 21:28)
        ✔ WindowManagement @done(03.05.20 - 15:02)
            Handles all the window closing and opening stuff
        ✔ Main @done(03.05.20 - 15:02)
            Creates a new StartScreen, prob won't do more than that
        ✔ TimeManagement @done(03.05.20 - 21:28)
            This will be the time cycle of the game
            Calls all the needed methods and has a variable delay


    ✔ Fruit @done(03.05.20 - 23:58)
        I probably wanna make a new class of fruit and out all the logic right there
        
    ✔ TimeFlow @done(03.05.20 - 23:58)
        Save the snake
        Call the paint method
        Save the given delay

    ☐ Stuff to do
        Maybe add apple icon?
        GameOver
        Controls
            Keyboard   
            DarkMode
            Delay


    WILO:   Kinda done with the main game I think
